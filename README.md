# Devops

This is my personal repository for all my DevOps-related stuff and guides. Here you'll find playbooks, roles, scripts, templates, and other resources that I've created or collected over time to automate and manage various tasks and projects. Whether you're new to DevOps or an experienced practitioner, I hope you'll find something useful here that can save you time and effort. Feel free to explore, contribute, or share feedback, and thanks for stopping by!

As of right now, there is a guide to setup a local cluster of VMs with VirtualBox.
